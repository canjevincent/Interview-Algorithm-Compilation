STRING FUNCTION REVERSE()

'word'   =>  'drow'

SELECT str, REVERSE(str) AS res 
FROM solution


STRING FUNCTION TRANSLATE()

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); 
you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

"ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
"GTAT" --> "CATA"

SELECT dna, TRANSLATE(dna, 'ATGC', 'TACG') AS res 
FROM dnastrand

STRING FUNCTION SUM()

Complete the function to return his total number of goals in all three leagues.
5, 10, 2  -->  17

SELECT (la_liga_goals + copa_del_rey_goals + champions_league_Goals) as res
  FROM goals;
  

STRING FUNCTION UPPER()

Write a function which converts the input string to uppercase.

select s, (upper(s)) as res
from makeuppercase
