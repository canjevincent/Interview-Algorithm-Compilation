-- Fetch employees who earn more than average salary of all employee

with average_salary (avg_sal) as 
      (select cast(avg(salary) as int) from employee)
select * 
from employee e, average_salary av
where e.salary > av.avg_sal;

-- Find stores who's sales where better than average sales across all stores

1) Total sales per each store.

select s.store_id, sum(cost) as total_sales_per_store
from sales s
group by s.store_id;

2) Find the average sales with respect all the stores.

select cast(avg(total_sales_per_store) as int) as avg_sales_for_all_stores
from (select s.store_id, sum(cost) as total_sales_per_store
      from sales s
      group by s.store_id) x;

3) Find the stores where Total_sales > Avg_sales of all stores.

Example 1 -- SUBQUERY

select *
from (select s.store_id, sum(cost) as total_sales_per_store
      from sales s
      group by s.store_id) total_sales
join (select cast(avg(total_sales_per_store) as int) as avg_sales_for_all_stores
      from ( select s.store_id, sum(cost) as total_sales_per_store
             from sales s
             group by s.store_id) x) avg_sales
on total_sales.total_sales_per_store > avg_sales.avg_sales_for_all_stores;

Example 2 (Optimized) -- WITH CLAUSE

with Total_Sales (store_id, total_sales_per_store) as
        (select s.store_id, sum(cost) as total_sales_per_store
        from sales s
        group by s.store_id),
     avg_sales (avg_sales_for_all_stores) as 
        (select cast(avg(total_sales_per_store) as int) as avg_sales_for_all_stores
        from Total_Sales)

select *
from Total_Sales ts
join avg_sales av
on ts.total_sales_per_store > av.avg_sales_for_all_stores
