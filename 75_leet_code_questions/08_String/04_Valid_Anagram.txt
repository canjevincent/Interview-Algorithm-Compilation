# Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
# Output: false

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
# s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
 

# Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

# Intuition:
# The Intuition is to determine if two strings are anagrams, compare the characters in both strings and check if they have the same characters but in a different order. By tracking the count of each character, if the counts match for all characters, the strings are anagrams; otherwise, they are not.

# Approach 1: Sorting
# Explanation:
# sort(s.begin(), s.end()); sorts the characters in string s in ascending order. This rearranges the characters in s so that they are in alphabetical order.
# sort(t.begin(), t.end()); sorts the characters in string t in ascending order. Similarly, this rearranges the characters in t to be in alphabetical order.
# return s == t; compares the sorted strings s and t using the equality operator (==). If the sorted strings are equal, it means that the original strings s and t have the same characters in the same order, indicating that they are anagrams. In this case, the function returns true. Otherwise, if the sorted strings are not equal, the function returns false, indicating that the strings are not anagrams.
# This code takes advantage of the fact that anagrams have the same characters, but in different orders. By sorting the characters, the code transforms the problem into a comparison of the sorted strings, simplifying the anagram check.

# However, it's worth noting that this approach has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the strings.

Code

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        sorted_s = sorted(s)
        sorted_t = sorted(t)
        return sorted_s == sorted_t

# Approach 2: Hash Table
# Explanation:
# Create an unordered map count to store the character frequencies. The key of the map represents a character, and the value represents its frequency.
# Iterate over each character x in string s. For each character, increment its frequency in the count map by using the count[x]++ expression.
# Iterate over each character x in string t. For each character, decrement its frequency in the count map by using the count[x]-- expression.
# Iterate over each pair x in the count map. Each pair consists of a character and its corresponding frequency. Check if any frequency (x.second) is non-zero. If any frequency is non-zero, it means there is a character that appears more times in one string than the other, indicating that the strings are not anagrams. In that case, return false.
# If all frequencies in the count map are zero, it means the strings s and t have the same characters in the same frequencies, making them anagrams. In this case, the function returns true.
# This approach counts the frequency of characters in one string and then adjusts the count by decrementing for the other string. If the strings are anagrams, the frequency of each character will cancel out, resulting in a map with all zero frequencies.

# The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total number of characters in both strings. It iterates over each character once to count the frequencies and then compares the frequencies in the map, making it an efficient solution for the problem.

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        count = defaultdict(int)
        
        # Count the frequency of characters in string s
        for x in s:
            count[x] += 1
        
        # Decrement the frequency of characters in string t
        for x in t:
            count[x] -= 1
        
        # Check if any character has non-zero frequency
        for val in count.values():
            if val != 0:
                return False
        
        return True

# Approach 3: Hash Table (Using Array)

# Code

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        count = [0] * 26
        
        # Count the frequency of characters in string s
        for x in s:
            count[ord(x) - ord('a')] += 1
        
        # Decrement the frequency of characters in string t
        for x in t:
            count[ord(x) - ord('a')] -= 1
        
        # Check if any character has non-zero frequency
        for val in count:
            if val != 0:
                return False
        
        return True

# Intuition
# To solve the anagram problem, we can count the frequency of each letter in both strings and compare them. If the frequencies of all letters are the same in both strings, then the two strings are anagrams of each other.

# Approach
# We can use an integer array freq of length 26 to keep track of the frequency of each letter in the two strings. We first check if the length of both strings is the same. If not, we return false because anagrams must have the same length. We loop through each character in both strings and increment the frequency of the corresponding letter in s and decrement the frequency of the corresponding letter in t.
# Finally, we loop through the freq array and check if all requencies are zero. If not, we return false. If all frequencies are zero, we return true because both strings are anagrams of each other.

# Complexity
# Time complexity: O(n)O(n)O(n), where n is the length of the strings. We need to loop through each character in both strings once to count the frequency of each letter, and then loop through the freq array once to check if all frequencies are zero.

# Space complexity: O(1)O(1)O(1), because the size of the freq array is fixed at 26, which is a constant value. Therefore, the space required to store the freq array does not depend on the length of the strings.
