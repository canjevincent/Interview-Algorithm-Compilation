CALCULUS 

A. Coding Question 3: Implement a function to calculate the numerical derivative of a given mathematical function at a specific point.

Assumptions: The input function will be provided as a Python lambda function or a string representation of a mathematical expression, and the point at which the derivative is calculated will be provided as a numeric value.

Sample Input: Function: f(x) = sin(x) Point: x = Ï€/4

Expected Output:

0.70710678118

B. Coding Question 4: Implement a function to find the definite integral of a given mathematical function within a specified interval.

Assumptions: The input function will be provided as a Python lambda function or a string representation of a mathematical expression, and the interval limits will be provided as numeric values.

Sample Input: Function: f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2 Interval: [1, 3]

Expected Output:

16.3333333333
