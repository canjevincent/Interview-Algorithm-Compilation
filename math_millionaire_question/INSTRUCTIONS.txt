We are delighted to inform you that you have been shortlisted as an applicant for the Junior Software Engineer position

As part of the selection process, we have designed a coding assessment tailored to evaluate your expertise in Python programming across various domains such as linear algebra, calculus, discrete mathematics, probability, and graph theory. You will be required to solve a total of 10 coding questions within a time limit of 80 minutes. The assessment will be conducted remotely, and you will be expected to record your progress while solving the coding exam.

Please note the following instructions for the coding assessment:

Time Limit: You have a total of 80 minutes to solve all 10 problems. Please manage your time effectively to ensure that you can attempt each question within the stipulated time.

Assessment Format: The coding assessment will be conducted remotely. You are required to record your screen and audio while solving the coding exam. The recording should capture your entire coding session, including the code-writing process and any explanations or thought processes you wish to share.

Submission Process: Once you have completed the coding exam, please upload the recording to Google Drive and provide a public link to the assigned Senior Engineer for evaluation. The public link should be shared with your referrer.

Code Authenticity: It is essential to emphasize that the solutions provided should be independently developed by you without the use of AI applications or any unauthorized assistance. We have stringent measures in place to verify the authenticity of the solutions, and any attempt to use AI applications or seek external assistance may lead to disqualification and a blacklist from future applications.

Evaluation Process: Your recorded coding session will be thoroughly reviewed by our Senior Engineer to assess your problem-solving capabilities, code quality, and adherence to best practices.

Final Selection: At the conclusion of the assessment process, only three candidates will be qualified for the next stage of the selection process based on their performance in the coding assessment.

We wish you the best of luck with the coding assessment, and we look forward to reviewing your solutions.

Should you have any further questions or require additional information, please feel free to reach out to us.
